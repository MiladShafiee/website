###  Human-like locomotion planning and control

#### 2017 – Present

---

<div style="text-align: justify">  We have started to develop  SURENA 4 humanoid robot and  I’m the leader of dynamic and control group of this project. The main goal of this project is developing a human-inspired humanoid robot. 
I am continuing the research this days, developing and implementing a human-like motion planning algorithm for SURENA 4 robot.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The locomotion planning methods for conventional humanoid robots have two main drawbacks that the generated locomotion patterns  by conventional methods are quasi-static and they walk with bent-knee(in order to avoiding singularity). 
In this research a novel method for human-like walking pattern generation is proposed based on introducing spatially quantized dynamic(SQD) of divergent component of motion(DCM). In contrast to conventional DCM based motion planning that a equation of motion is discretized by a constant step time, in our method the DCM dynamic quantized by a constant unit length along the desired direction. To this end, first we design a kinematic pattern for walking based on human motion with stretched knee. Then we map this kinematic pattern into time space based on SQD of DCM. Using our scheme, a general and real time motion planner is designed which can be used for human like motion planning in different scenarios.
Using the idea of time-varying DCM, our controller is capable of dealing with walking with larger step length that causes traversing bigger obstacles
and fewer power consumption.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Now, I'm adding an optimization-based balance recovery controller to proposed scheme that adaptate the step position and duration under external disturbances. The following video shows the simulation of this algorithm.</div>
