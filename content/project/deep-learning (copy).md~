Design and implementation of an unmanned autonomous boat in 2nd ASV (Autonomous Surface Vehicle) competition (Sharif University of Technology). It started with the conceptual design of a high speed autonomous unmanned boat. After 9 month of massive teamwork for conceptual and detail design, we reached a final design for implementation. The entire structure of the boat was built according to the initial design using lightweight fiberglass during a 6 month period. Integrating a GPS with a Compass autonomous system of the boat accomplished. We ranked first in all of items of the competition including speed, maneuver, autonomous circle and autonomous spiral items
