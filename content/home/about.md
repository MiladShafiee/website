# Biography

My name is Milad shafiee. I am a robotics researcher intrested on the use of optimal control and machine learning algorithms for motion planning and control of robots.


I received my master degree in Mechanical engineering from University of Tehran in 2017. Since 2015, I have been a research assistant in the Dynamic and Control group of [SURENA humanoid robot](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/iran-humanoid-robot-surena-iii) projects at [CAST](http://castech-en.com/), University of Tehran. My research area during recent years focused on the locomotion planning and control of biped robots, where I used the [SURENA](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/iran-humanoid-robot-surena-iii) and [Surena Mini](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/iran-surena-mini) humanoid robots as research platforms and I have involved in many experiments for motion planning and control of SURENA and SURENA Mini humanoid robots. My focus during my master thesis is devoted to employing whole capablilty of a humanoid robot for balance recovery in a single Model Predictive Controller.


Since 2017, I'm also the leader of Dynamics and Control group of SURENA 4 Humanoid robot project at CAST and I currently work on developing a rubust and human-like motion planning algorithm for SURENA4 humanoid robot.
